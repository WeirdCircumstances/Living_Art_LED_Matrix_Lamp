# Living_Art_LED_Matrix_Lamp
This is LED matrix code for a "living art" desk lamp, that can also switch to use a normal white desk lamp or a red nightlight
The LEDs in the lamp are controlled by an Arduino Nano that creates colorful moving patterns, aka, “living art.”  However, it is also very practical for use as a desk lamp, table lamp, or bedside lamp, since an LED push button allows you to switch from the living-art mode to normal white-light modes, and a red-nightlight mode.
